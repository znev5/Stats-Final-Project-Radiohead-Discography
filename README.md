# Radiohead-Final-Project
## **Instructions**
To access and utilize my script, please open the "final_project_script.R" file containing all of my script data.

## **Data**
I analyzed three albums of Radiohead, five different variables, and thirty-four, unique, total observations. The five variables I analyzed consisted of the album title, the length of each song in seconds, the number of plays each song has, the release year, and my enjoyment of each song. In terms of gathering my data, I used the streaming service Spotify and gathered most of my statistical data from there. 

In terms of obtaining data, I used the hit music streaming service, Spotify to obtain information for four different variables I wanted to look at. While you couldâ€™ve used another streaming service, I felt that I had been using Spotify for the past few years and that the data they had available was accurate for the most part. I ran certain tests such as ANOVA, chi-squared, and others to compare and contrast the variables.

## **Operationalization**
The concept of the length of songs is a quantitative variable that represents the length of each song in seconds. The range for Length of Songs (in seconds) has a minimum of 129 seconds and a max of  367 seconds.

The concept of the number of plays is a quantitative variable that represents the number of plays each song has. 1 play equals 1 listen added to the song. The Number of Plays had a range between a minimum of 20,850,274 plays and a maximum of 630,641,266 plays.

The concept of release year is a qualitative variable that each unique variable has. There are three years that a song can be put into depending on its official release year. The three years a song can be put into are 1995, 1997, or 2007.

The concept of enjoyability is a qualitative variable that each unique variable is put into. There are three categories and they are Bad, being the lowest, Good, being the middle, and Great, being the highest.
